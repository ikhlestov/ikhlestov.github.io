    Hi, I'm Illarion Khlestov.

    I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, computer vision and programming. I like to participate in conferences, share my knowledge and teach others.
    
    However, sometimes it's hard to keep everything you know in your head.
    That's why I've decided to keep notes in one place and organize them efficiently.
    Some notes dive deeply into exact topic and some of them just briefly describe main ideas and milestones.

    If you are looking for the actual blog, with posts and fancy images, now it's hosted at the `medium <https://medium.com/@illarionkhlestov>`__.
    Also you may be interested in my `GitHub <https://github.com/ikhlestov>`__ or  `Lnkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikhlestov/>`__.
