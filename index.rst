    Hi, I'm Illarion Khlestov.

    I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, computer vision, and programming. I like to participate in conferences, share my knowledge, and teach others.
    
    However, sometimes it's hard to keep everything you know in your head.
    That's why I've decided to keep notes in one place and organize them efficiently. You may find two main sections:

    - `Pages <pages>`__ where I store hierarchically organized succinct notes about each topic
    - `Blog posts <posts>`__ where I have a broader view on topics, with examples and explanation

    Note that blog posts under heavy development, so at present, there is only one post. Better check `pages <pages>`__ section.

    Also, you may be interested in my `GitHub <https://github.com/ikhlestov>`__ or  `Linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikhlestov/>`__.
