Hi to all! There only a few days I've set up this blog and I've decided that there should be at least one post.
The main purpose of this blog to collect and organize some coding related info.
At the `Pages <link://slug/pages-index>`__, I will keep lists with useful commands mainly without the long explanation.
At the Blogs, I will post some more verbose things. Will see how it will go.
