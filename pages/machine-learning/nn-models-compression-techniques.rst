Recent research of the neural networks mainly focused on the improving accuracy.
Despite this, there are exist a lot of methods to reduce models size and speed up them.
Here I will try briefly discuss each of methods and compare them among each other.

Pruning
=======

Pruning initially was proposed on Jun 2015 at `Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626>`__ paper. Main idea of this method is:

- Train whole network
- Prune some connections that less than required threshold
- Retrain pruned network. If we not perform retraining model accuracy can be decreased a lot.

Last two steps can be repeated several times.

As the result we will receive such representation of the model:

During pruning such additional updates should be done to the model:

- The pruning threshold is chosen as a quality parameter multiplied by the standard deviation of a layerâ€™s weights.
- Use L2 regularization to push the weights near to zero. In paper was reported that use of the L1 regularization is unreasonable.
- Update dropout is some exist with such rule. It can updated as :math:`D_{r} = D_{o} \sqrt{\frac{C_{ir}}{C_{io}}}`, where:
  
  - :math:`D_{r}` - our new dropout rate
  - :math:`D_{o}` - previous dropout rate
  - :math:`C_{io}` - number of connections in layer :math:`i` in original network
  - :math:`C_{ir}` - number of connections in layer :math:`i` in the network after retraining

- Learn model after pruning with lower learning rate.
- Convert model to sparse matrix.
- Batch norm?? Hm, I think it didn't exist yet when pruning was proposed
- Authors said that we can 2x reduce number of the neurons even without retraining

For training in some framework:

- Train network as usual
- For pruning we can just multiply each layer with binary mask
- Perform retraining with layer initialized from previous network
- Convert retrained network to sparse tensors

Also you should note that there two approaches for squeezing exist - one for model size reducing, and another for model speedup.
