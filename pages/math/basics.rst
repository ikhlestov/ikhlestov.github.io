An **integer** is a positive or negative number without a fractional or decimal component: -1, 2, 0.

An **even number** is an integer evenly divisible by two: -4, 0, 2, 8.

An **odd number** is an integer that is not evenly divisible by two: -5, 3, 9.

A **positive number** any number > 0. A **Negative number** any number < 0.

The sum of tree consecutive integers is three times the value of the middle number. :math:`3 + 4 + 5 = 4 * 3`.

"3 less than X" means "X - 3".

- "If A, then B" - **implication**. Let's say that this is true.

- "If B, then A" - **converse**. May or may not be true.

- "If not A, than not B" - **inverse**. May or may not be true.

- "If not B, then not A" - **contrapositive**. Always true.

If fraction ":math:`5/10`" :math:`5` is **numerator** and :math:`10` is **denominator**. Numerator increasing more rapidly than the denominator.

**Unit rate** is how much of something there is per one unit of something else (ex: 1 km/h).

Divisibility rules:

- :math:`1` - all integers are divisible by 1.

- :math:`2` - the last digit is even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

- :math:`3` - the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.

- :math:`4` - the last two digits are divisible by 4.

- :math:`5` - the last digit is 0 or 5.

- :math:`6` - the number is divisible by 2 and 3.

- :math:`7` - double the last digit. Subtract this value from the remaining digits. This number should be divisible by 7.

- :math:`8` - the last three digits are divisible by 8.

- :math:`9` - the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.
